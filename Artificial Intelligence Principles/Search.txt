Problem solving agents are goal-directed agents:
  1. Goal Formulation: Set of one or more (desirable) world states (e.g. checkmate in chess)
  2. Problem Formulation: What actions and states to consider given a goal and initial state
  3. Search for a solution: Given the problem, search for a solution -- a sequence of actions to achieve the goal starting from the initial state
  4. Execution of solution

Example: Path Finding Problem

1. Formulate goal, get to X city
2. Formulate Problem, drive between cities starting from an initial state
3. Find solution, try sequences of cities, determine efficiency with each different path
4. Execute Solution, drive from initial state to X city according to the best solution
