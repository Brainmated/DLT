Transform the following sentences into Logic statements
a.	If someone drives a car and is drunk, then this person breaks the law.
b.	John drives his Mercedes.
c.	Mercedes is a car.
d.	John is drunk.

p = drives a car
q = is drunk
r = breaks the law

Ex((p(x) ^ q(x)) -> r(x)

Translate the above English sentences to First-Order Logic (FOL) using the appropriate predicates, such as: Drives(x,y), Car(x), BreaksLaw(x), Drunk(x) and define any other you might need to add.

Drives(x,y)
Car(x)
BreaksLaw(x)
Drunk(x)

a. E(x)((Drives(x,y) ^ Car(y) ^ Drunk(x)) -> BreaksLaw(x)
b. Drives(x,y) x = John, y = Mercedes
c. Car(y) y = Mercedes
d. Drunk(x) x = John

Then convert the knowledgebase to CNF. 

F(x)(Drives(x,y) ^ Car(y) ^ Drunk(x)) -> BreaksLaw(x)
Implication Elimination: >(F(x)(Drives(x,y) ^ Car(y) ^ Drunk(x))) U BreaksLaw(x)
De Morgan's Law: Ex((Drives(x,y) ^ Car(y) ^ Drunk(x)) ^ >BreaksLaw(x)
Distributivity: (Ex Drives(x,y) ^ Ex Car(y) ^ Drunk(x)) ^ >BreaksLaw(x)
