My training repository for deep learning algorithms. Hopefully here I will upload my training path in better understanding the early stages of deep learning with tools such as image classification algorithms, optical character recognition models and recommendation systems.

I have just started working with the MNIST dataset to get a grasp of the possibilities of OCR from the first step of image classification. My first lesson starts with the "GNT Learning" training video on Tensorflow and Keras. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU0FFjYumCI&t=2005s
As of today, I upload my hands-on work which will be referred to from time to time to help me build a proper OCR application which will benefit individuals and organizations alike to translate hand-written texts to a digitized mean.

With the of Digital Humanities T.M. i've managed to get a better grasp of Optical Character Recognition. Through my research and tutorials provided by PyTesseract and the numpy library I've managed to work with image processing, attribute/metadata changes and character readings such as of the Polytonics(Greek). In /OCR I will beging developing more efficient classes which can help reduce distractions in reading text from older images, improve readability and remove unecessary bording to help read, distribute and index information faster and with greater accuracy.
