My training repository for deep learning algorithms. Hopefully here I will upload my training path in better understanding the early stages of deep learning with tools such as image classification algorithms, optical character recognition models and recommendation systems.

I have just started working with the MNIST dataset to get a grasp of the possibilities of OCR from the first step of image classification. My first lesson starts with the "GNT Learning" training video on Tensorflow and Keras. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU0FFjYumCI&t=2005s
As of today, I upload my hands-on work which will be referred to from time to time to help me build a proper OCR application which will benefit individuals and organizations alike to translate hand-written texts to a digitized mean.
